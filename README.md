# 3dGuessing
Guess coordinates in 3d in a 10x10x10 cube
After you guess a coordinate, the game responds if you are 1) correct, or 2)wrong, and tells you in which direction the answer is(i.e. Up or Down, North South East West). You can also rotate the cube to see it from different viewpoints for more clarity.
